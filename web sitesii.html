<p> I am a student at Mersin University. I am third grade right now and looking forward to finish my school as soon as possible. I love coding. In my period of student, i've started to love coding even more. But my special interest is kinda different. My special interest is databases and and 3D modeling. Im basicly using 3D modeling methot in to games by using MakeHuman but haven't done businesses yet. I also have some knowledge with AutoCad and Unreal Engine. <br> <br> Besides of these i have some works that i have done with web design by using node.js. <br>
My most important study and learning phase is definately Math Softwaring and App Softwaring. I have started to learn python thanks for that classes and im grateful for it. <br> My future plan is simple. Get a job. Be a qualified programmer. Save some money. And start a company all by myself. Most recently me and my crew started to game developping and we are going too good right now. If we can make it to the top, which is publishing a game. I have to rethink my plans again. <br>
