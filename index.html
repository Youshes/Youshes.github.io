<p> I am a student at Mersin University. I am third grade right now and looking forward to finish my school as soon as possible. I love coding. In my period of student, i've started to love coding even more. But my special interest is kinda different. My special interest is databases and and 3D modeling. Im basicly using 3D modeling methot in to games by using MakeHuman but haven't done businesses yet. I also have some knowledge with AutoCad and Unreal Engine. <br> <br> Besides of these i have some works that i have done with web design by using node.js. <br>
My most important study and learning phase is definately Math Softwaring and App Softwaring. I have started to learn python thanks for that classes and im grateful for it. <br> My future plan is simple. Get a job. Be a qualified programmer. Save some money. And start a company all by myself. Most recently me and my crew started to game developping and we are going too good right now. If we can make it to the top, which is publishing a game. I have to rethink my plans again. <br>
<br>
There is no such a project that continuing nowadays but i had one in my mind which is quite good for improve and salary. The goal of this project is getting reading book datas from students in Universities of Turkey and advice them back that they might like similar books. My target users is defintely going to be students of Turkey in the beginning but i might extend my target ratio later. The reason why i'll start up this project is simple. The percent of reading books in Turkey is so low and we have to raise it while we getting money in the first place.<br> It will help the percentage of reading.
It'll going to be in an app on every mobile platform and users can use this app easily. There is no risk of using this app. <br> 

App will include add's and thats will be the main income return and app is going to accept any kind of support. Thats will be all of our income return.
